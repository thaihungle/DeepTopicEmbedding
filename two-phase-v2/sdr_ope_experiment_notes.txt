sdr ope comments==========================
1)Phase 1's role in two phase framework?
- with Phase 2 even use random L1 normalized beta works--> the accuracy drops little (down 1-2% to 83-84%) 
- without Phase 2 use random L1 normalized beta fails--> the accuracy is only 6%
2)Using Phase 1 as OPE make it faster, scalble and maybe higher accuracy. 
However, it is less stable. The accuracy rate fluctuates a little bit
